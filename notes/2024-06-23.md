1. Google has retired IoT core so no point building against that. Will look to push Esp32 messages on to pub/sub directly
1. Initial searches for ESP32 Google Pub/Sub client all refer to MQTT and IOT hub, which isn't going to help. To keep things simple, I'll start with a Cloud Run job
1.1 Cloud Run can scale (which I don't care about at this point) but it can also expose a service on a public IP, can host Python and will enable proxing incoming data through to a pub/sub topic.
1.1 Can use a code deployment method, so no need to build a container
1.1 Can host long running tasks, such as waiting for incoming connections. This is a CloudRun service, not a CloudRun job
1.1 Free tier will probably cover all costs
1.1 Can have a custom domain, for later ;)
1. I want to learn more about terraform, having managed teams that use it but never written any Terraform code. Therefore, starting with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yz1UfFAxdo but first https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEVUDgz7o2Y to learn the basic VS Code set up for Terraform and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9Nfa_PxK20
Installed "Terraform" by Anton Kilukov and GitLens VSCode Extensions
1. Created new project
1. Create new service account called "tf worker" and added "Cloud Run Admin" and "Service Account User" rights
1. Copy service definition into main.tf from https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/cloud_run_v2_service
1. Container Registry has been replaced by Artifact Registry
1. https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/google-samples/us/containers list the public images, but I couldn't work out how to navigate to here
1. Terraform plan, apply and destroy all work as expected. CloudRun job created.
